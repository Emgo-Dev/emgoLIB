# Math Operations

## Area

The area formula finds the measurement of the area within a space/perimeter. The area is equal to the length of the space multiplied by the width

```
Area = length x width
Area = radius * radius
```

To find the area of a radius (circle)

```
Math.PI * radius * radius
```

## Perimeter

The perimeter formula finds length of the surrounding edge/border of a space/area.

The perimeter is equal to all of the sides of an object added up together.

```
Perimeter = (length * 2) + (width * 2)
```

To find the perimeter of a radius (circle);

```
2 * Math.PI * radius
```
