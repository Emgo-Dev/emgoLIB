# Math Terminology

**Composite Numbers**: A Composite Number is a whole number that can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 or itself.
Example: 9 can be divided evenly by 3 (as well as 1 and 9), so 9 is a composite number. But 7 cannot be divided evenly (except by 1 and 7), so is NOT a composite number (it is a prime number).

**Prime Numbers**: A Prime Number can be divided evenly only by 1, or itself. It must be a whole number greater than 1.

> 5 can only be divided evenly by 1 or 5, so it is a prime number. But 6 can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3 and 6 so it is NOT a prime number (it is a composite number).
